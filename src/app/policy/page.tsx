			<p><em>Last updated: 09/11/2024</em></p>

			<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Welcome to <strong>techshift.community</strong> (&#34;TechShift&#34;). By accessing or using TechShift,
				you agree to comply with this Privacy Policy (&#34;This Policy&#34;). This Policy outlines how TechShift
				handles the information and personal data you provide to us, enabling us to effectively manage our
				relationship with you.
			</p>

			<p>
				This Policy applies to our website <Link href={'/'}>techshift.community</Link> (&#34;Site&#34;),
				including any other media form, media channel, mobile website, or mobile application related or
				connected
				thereto (collectively, &#34;Our Services&#34;). This policy aims to give you a clear understanding of
				the data we collect, why we collect it, how we process it, the entities with whom we share your personal
				data, your rights regarding your data, and other pertinent matters related to privacy and security.
			</p>

			<p>By using our Site, you acknowledge and agree that your personal data may be processed in the manner
				set out in this Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use
				the Site or provide us with your Personal Data.</p>

			<p><strong>TechShift</strong> is a non-profit community dedicated to fostering collaboration and
				innovation within the tech ecosystem. We do not operate as a commercial entity.</p>

			<p>
				All processing of Personal Data performed by TechShift as outlined in this Privacy Policy shall be
				carried out in accordance with:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Maltese Data Protection Act (Chapter 586 of the Laws of Malta) and any subsidiary
					legislation issued under the DPA, as amended from time to time; and
				</li>
				<li>Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of The European Parliament and of The Council of 27 April 2016 on the
					Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free
					Movement of Such Data (General Data Protection Regulation) (&#34;GDPR&#34;).
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The DPA and the GDPR are collectively referred to as the “Data Protection Laws.”</p>

			<p>TechShift determines the means and purposes of processing Personal Data and therefore acts as the
				“Data Controller” under the applicable Data Protection Laws.</p>

			<h2>2. Definitions</h2>

			<h3>2.1 The Data Controller</h3>
			<p>The “Data Controller” means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body
				which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal
				data.</p>

			<h3>2.2 Personal Data</h3>
			<p>“Personal Data” means any information that identifies you individually or relates to an identified or
				identifiable natural person.</p>

			<h2>3. Security</h2>
			<p>We have implemented appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being
				accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. Additionally, we
				limit access to your personal data to those individuals who need access to perform their duties. We
				have procedures in place to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any
				applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

			<h2>4. Personal Data Protection</h2>
			<p>Personal Data held by us is protected using industry-standard security processes and systems. Our
				commitment to protecting personal data is upheld through high standards and the most efficient
				application of the law. We are bound to process personal data only based on a legitimate and lawful
				reason as established in the GDPR.</p>

			<h2>5. Processing on the Basis of Our Legitimate Interests</h2>
			<p>A legitimate interest exists when we have a community or operational reason to process your personal
				data. In such cases, we ensure that your personal data is protected and that the processing does not
				unfairly impact your rights or interests.</p>

			<p>When we process your personal data based on legitimate interests, we will inform you of such, explain
				the legitimate interests we rely on, and provide a process for you to raise any questions or
				objections regarding such processing. Please note that we are not obligated to stop processing if
				our legitimate interests outweigh your right to object.</p>

			<h2>6. Data Retention Policy</h2>
			<p>We retain your Personal Data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this
				Privacy Policy, considering the purpose for which it was originally obtained. The criteria used to
				determine the retention period include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The length of our relationship with you.</li>
				<li>The nature and purpose of the data.</li>
				<li>Legal requirements.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Generally, we retain data for the duration necessary to provide our services and comply with legal
				obligations. Once your Personal Data is no longer required, we will securely delete or anonymize
				it.</p>

			<p>Failure to provide necessary Personal Data may prevent us from fulfilling our obligations and
				providing requested services.</p>

			<h2>7. Information We Collect, Purpose of Processing & Legal Basis</h2>

			<p>Since TechShift does not require user registration or login, the data we collect is minimal and
				primarily through Google Analytics. Below is an outline of the data we collect, the purposes for
				which we collect it, and the legal basis for processing.</p>

			<h3>7.1 Personal Data Collected</h3>
			<p>Currently, we do not collect Personal Data through registration or user accounts. The only Personal
				Data we may collect includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> If you reach out to us via contact forms or email (e.g.,
					name, email address).
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>7.2 Non-Personal Data Collected</h3>
			<p>We collect non-personally identifiable information through Google Analytics, including:</p>

			<h2>8. Processing on the Basis of Consent</h2>
			<p>Since we do not currently collect Personal Data through user registration or login, processing based
				on consent is limited. However, if we collect Personal Data through contact forms, we may process it
				based on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time.</p>

			<p>If you withdraw your consent, we will determine whether we can continue processing your Personal Data
				based on another legal ground, such as compliance with a legal obligation. Any withdrawal of consent
				will not affect the legality of processing conducted prior to the withdrawal.</p>

				of cookies and similar technologies.</p>

					users interact with our Site.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Legal Authorities:</strong> If required by law or in response to lawful requests by
					public authorities.

				or third parties in connection with Personal Data before we receive it, including any transfers of

			<p>Our Site may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not operated by us. We are
				not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third parties. We encourage you to
				review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.</p>

			<h2>16. Transfer of Data Outside of the EEA</h2>
			<p>Your personal data may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries that
				may not offer the same level of data protection as within the EEA. In such cases, we ensure that

					EEA standards.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Adequacy Decisions:</strong> Relying on countries deemed by the European Commission to
